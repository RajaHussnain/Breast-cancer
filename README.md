The problem statement:

In this project 800 breast ultrasound images along with their mask(ground truth) files that have been manually classified into benign, malignant and normal labels. To train a CNN resnet model is used and the model is evaluated on an unseen test data. CNNs prove to be the most effective solutions for addressing image classification/segmentation and computer vision problems.

Two Approaches are used:
1: Without mask files
2: Utilizing mask files by creating overlay
