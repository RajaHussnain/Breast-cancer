The problem statement:

In this project we have close to 800 breast ultrasound images along with their mask(ground truth) files that have been manually classified into benign, malignant and normal labels. We will try to train a CNN(resnet model in this case) and evaluate teh model on an unseen test data. CNNs sare the most effective solutions for addressing image classification/segmentation and computer vision problems.
